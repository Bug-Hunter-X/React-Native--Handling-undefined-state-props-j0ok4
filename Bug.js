This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been assigned a value.  This commonly happens when a component renders before the asynchronous operation that sets the state or prop has completed. For example, if you're fetching data from an API, the component might render before the data has been retrieved, causing the app to crash with a `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...property...')` error.
